# TidyTuesday

### Greetings!!!

  My name is **_Sandy Illescas_** and I am a first semester graduate student.  The beginning of the semester was a bit of a rough start, but I am still grateful to have taken this course at the beginning of my graduate journey.  Frankly, I thought it was going to be impossible to learn how to code in the short span of one semester.  I thought the most I would learn was how to create documents and maybe simple graphs, but I was gladly mistaken.  It is certainly not easy nor "quick", but it is extremely rewarding and not as hard and scary as it first seemed.  I have actually found it therapeutic in having the ability to create something beautiful, from a blank page, all the way to fruition.
  
  I look forward to using the skills I have learned from this course and apply it whenever the opportunity arises. I am especially excited to use the skills I learned while doing all my tidy Tuesdays...even if I did them all in one day.  It actually motivated me to work with more Tidy Tuesday data sets, just so I get some more practice in.  
  
  I hope you enjoy what I've come up with, these were fun!
  
  Yaaaay!!! I'm finally **DONE**
