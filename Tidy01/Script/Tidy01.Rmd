### Tidy Tuesday 
#### (or all night Thursday and all day Friday)

For this Tidy I will be using the most recent dataset.  I was planning to start with older ones, but being a single parent, I know all too well what childcare costs. 

##### Let's Go

## Load Libraries
```{r}

library(here)
library(ggplot2)# for graph
library(gganimate) #to animate
library(readr) #to read data filefile
library(dplyr) #to tribble data

```

Next, we have to load our dataset

## Load Dataset
<!-Good Lord, this data set is huge!!->
```{r, include=TRUE}

childcare_costs <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/childcare_costs.csv')

glimpse(childcare_costs) # VERY large data set

```

####Now that the data is loaded, I want to check to see if there are any constants that need to be remove so these do not become a problem when we are trying to graph something.

### JUST KIDDING...

####Apparently I copied the "raw" dataset that needs to be cleaned and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working, I tried to filter figure it out but all of the suggestions I found were not working, here is a screenshot of the message.

####I am fairly certain that I wasn't mapping it correctly. 

![Error](/Users/SandyCruz/Desktop/Repositories/Illescas_Tidy_Tuesdays/Tidy01/Data/Images/Error_Message.png)

So I loaded the data the sure way to save time.

#### I just realized can add a picture from anywhere on my computer by coding the full file path. Sweet.


###Let's continue with our goal

I am going to graph and animate the prices ranges of family-run daycare over time ggplot.

```{r ggplot, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

# creating a scatter plot 
p <- ggplot(childcare_costs, aes(x = study_year, y =  mfcc_preschool, color = study_year)) + # This is only counting family-run day care centers, but I thought that would be long title
  geom_point(size = 3) + #allows us to choose the size of the point. 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2006:2020, labels = 2006:2020) + # this allows us to specify the tick values on the x-axis.
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
   # We need to see the symbol for money
  labs(title = 'Childcare Price Over Time', x = 'Year', y = 'Price of Family Daycare (per week)') + #labels axis and title
  theme_minimal() # setting theme

p


p_anim <- p +
  transition_states(study_year, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +
  labs(title = 'Year: {closest_state}') # transition_states allows us to animate the plot depending on what you want to base the color change off of. 

animate(p_anim) # display the animation

```
